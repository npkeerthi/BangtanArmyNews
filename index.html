    <p><i>To be straight we are actually searching a passionate singer , If they are really worth then ,can definitely count on us to turn them to an <big>idol</big>  <br/> Its not like we lack one member
      Its just because we know how arduous it was for us to reach this position , And As You ,my one of the armies might <br/>be as talented as our kookie ,like all rounder, and even more worth than us ,as its our responsibility to check on our dear ones we came forward with this.
    </i></p>

    <h2> And 8 <sup>th</sup> Member </h2>

    <p> <i>On our jungkook's suggestion if we really get a great army as idol then he wants to give a place for you with us , And guys not permanantly ,<br/> As its opposing with our management rules. So behalf of Your kookie our next song might be with one of you
    <br/>
    This is because he knew how many ups and downs his mind gone through to stay with us so he really wants to give a chance to our loved ones
    <br/> And guys guys guys if  they are not too lucky may not be this but they would really be an idol if they are worth of it.</i> </p>
